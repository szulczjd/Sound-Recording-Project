# Sound-Recording-Project
This project involved recording a sound level from a microphone and date from rtc to SD disk.
The values of the sound level and date is displayed on a I2C OLED.
The Pro Mini was programmed with FTID232 module.
I could only get Windows OS to communicate with the Pro Mini. 
The Apple OSX would not find the FTID module dispite repeated attempts.
